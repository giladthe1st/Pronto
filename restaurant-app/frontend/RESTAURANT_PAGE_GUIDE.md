# Restaurant Listing Page Guide

## Overview
This page displays restaurant information in a responsive tabular format. Each restaurant is shown as a row with columns for:

- Restaurant Name
- Deals
- Menu
- Reviews 
- Location

## Components

### RestaurantList.tsx
The main component that renders the restaurant table with headers and iterates through the restaurant data to create rows.

### RestaurantRow.tsx
Handles the display of individual restaurant entries with both:
- Desktop view: Clean tabular format with 5 columns
- Mobile view: Card-based layout optimized for smaller screens

## Sample Data
The application currently uses sample restaurant data defined in the RestaurantList component. In a production environment, this would be replaced with API calls to fetch real restaurant data.

## Design Considerations
- Fully responsive design that adapts to screen sizes
- Separate mobile and desktop views for optimal user experience
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. Add filtering capabilities by location, rating, or cuisine
2. Implement sorting functionality for each column
3. Add pagination for larger datasets
4. Create detail pages for each restaurant
5. Add a search function
6. Add restaurant images
